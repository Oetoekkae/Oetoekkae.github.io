                            Bust a block is a little game that started its life as a small part of a bigger group project during my second year in IT studies.<br>
                            It evolved from a browser game made with react.js into a standalone java version for android and finally into a
                            full blown mobile game made with unity and C#.<br>
                            Quite a long journey for a small game, but also a big learning experience for myself.

                            <p>The game started its life as a react component part of a bigger project and can be considered as a proof of consept for further developement <br>
                            The idea is quite simple; navigate a block through other falling blocks, the longer a player can survive the bigger their score will be <br>
                            Game was basic and simple, hostile block spawning worked as a group of blocks spawning at the same time and score was calculated from the time stayed alive</p>

                            Pelimo project was about a learning game aimed towards middle school aged kids.<br>
                            The aim of the game was to teach kindness towards people from different cultures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was hired for the project to build a localisation system for the game in order to let Swedish speaking kids enjoy
                            the game too.<br>
                            The whole job lasted about two and a half months. During that time, I managed to succesfully create a
                            localisation system to translate all necessary parts of the game. I also got assigned to create a few minigames for
                            the game, fixing some general bugs, polishing and adding some features to the final product.

                            Player then needs to rearrange the syllables to form the original word. <br>
                            There is a two minute time limit and each correct answer gives a small time bonus, while a wrong answer gives a time penalty.<br>
                            When the time runs out, score is given and the player can examine how many of their asnwers were right or wrong.</p>

                                The game gives the player a little hint about the object and that object needs to be found within the given timelimit.
                                After the object is found, the player is given a little fun fact relating to the object.
